## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The idea for Certik came from the need to test the viability of cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts coupled with the defects in testing mechanisms. Program testing provided an insufficient certainty verification. As Edsger Dijkstra pointed, “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.” https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/technology/webinar-columbia-university-alumni-weekend-reinvented-trustworthy-blockchain-systems-ronghui-gu


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Certik’s customers are blockchain and smart contract platforms. Some of its leading clients include Aave, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Yearn, and Chili. 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Previous attempts at formal verification while effective, were manually intensive and costly (consider one of the industry leaders, Quantstamp, which requires significantly more analysts to perform the same process). Certik, is designed to use machine learning to solve this gap.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Certik is a in the Crypto Curries domain, specifically in the blockchain security field.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Auditing blockchain has gone from an ‘above and beyond’ measure to a practical necessity. The changes in the landscape can best be described in Certik’s own COO’s words: “While basic exploits still occur from coding errors such as reentrancy, those vulnerabilities are typically well known and easily avoided. Instead, many of the largest attacks that we’ve seen in the past 12 months have been exploits of a protocol’s financial logic – taking advantage of a very specific series of interactions in order to exploit a flaw. Flash loan attacks are an example of this sophisticated kind of attack that combines technical expertise with an understanding of inter-platform financial interactions.“

Quantstamp and Zeppelin are two of the largest players in the industry. Qedit, Monerium, Orchid Labs, and SYBX Group 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?



* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

Currently Certik only reveals platform vulnerabilities and offers advice in patching them up. They do not fix any issues. They could add to the service the option to fix common bugs.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Offering this service would allow Certik to leverage its expertise and save its client companies time and manpower, which in turn would make Certik a more desirable option and put it ahead of its competitors.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

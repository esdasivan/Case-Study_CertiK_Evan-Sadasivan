# CertiK CASE Study

## Overview and Origin

* The company name is Certik

* CertiK was incorporated in 2018  

* It was founded by Ronghui Gu, Assistant Professor at Colombia University and Zhong Shao, professor of computer science at Yale University

* Certik is funded by 14 investors and as of February 13th 2022, Certik has received 152.2 Million over 8 rounds. 	


## Business Activities:

*The idea for Certik came from the need to test the viability of cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts coupled with the defects in testing mechanisms. Program testing provided an insufficient certainty verification. As Edsger Dijkstra pointed, “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.” 

* Certik’s customers are blockchain and smart contract platforms. Some of its leading clients include Aave, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Yearn, and Chili. 

* Previous attempts at formal verification while effective, were manually intensive and costly (consider one of the industry leaders, Quantstamp, which requires significantly more analysts to perform the same process). Certik, is designed to use machine learning to solve this gap.

* CertiK is actively using 25 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF

## Landscape:

* Certik is a in the Crypto Currencies domain, specifically in the blockchain security field.

* Auditing blockchain has gone from an ‘above and beyond’ measure to a practical necessity. The changes in the landscape can best be described in Certik’s own COO’s words: “While basic exploits still occur from coding errors such as reentrancy, those vulnerabilities are typically well known and easily avoided. Instead, many of the largest attacks that we’ve seen in the past 12 months have been exploits of a protocol’s financial logic – taking advantage of a very specific series of interactions in order to exploit a flaw. Flash loan attacks are an example of this sophisticated kind of attack that combines technical expertise with an understanding of inter-platform financial interactions.“

* Quantstamp and Zeppelin are two of the largest players in this industry. Qedit, Monerium, Orchid Labs, and SYBX Group 

## Results

* CertiK is new enough that it's hard to gage the results of its role in the Fintech space, however, it is clearly helping to drive the transition between auditing as an option and auditing as a necessity.

* One metric for CertiK's performance is the number of discrete centralization risks found. According to Coindesk, CertiK found 286 discrete centralization risks through the 1,737 projects it audited

## Recommendations

* Currently Certik only reveals platform vulnerabilities and offers advice in patching them up. They do not fix any issues. They could add to the service the option to fix common bugs. Furthermore, they could offer to set up smart contracts for clients rather than merely auditing them.

* Offering this service would allow Certik to leverage its expertise and save its client companies time and manpower, which in turn would make Certik a more desirable option and put it ahead of its competitors.


* This would require significantly more infrastructure and human labor costs as well as blockchain technologies/distributed ledgers


* These blockchain resources would allow CertiK to draft and assist with smart contracts of their own.
